/* This file exists to solve the circular dependency problem:
 *
 * - `MotionSubject = withMotionOperators(IndefiniteSubject)`
 * - `withMotionOperators(superclass)` adds `_remember` to `superclass`
 * - `_remember()` returns a `MotionSubject`
 *
 * Since `_remember()` doesn't actually need a reference to `MotionSubject`
 * until you call it, this should work fine; in fact, it would work perfectly if
 * the whole library was defined in a single file.  Unfortunately, splitting the
 * library into modules causes a problem:  When `operators/_remember` is
 * imported, it tries to resolve `MotionSubject`, which doesn't exist until
 * `withMotionOperators` can run, which can't run unless `_remember` exists.
 *
 * `proxies` breaks this cycle.  When each of the Motion observables is defined,
 * it tries to call `fulfillProxies()`.  When they have all been defined, that
 * call will succeed, which will cause the variables in this file to reference
 * the canonical definitions in the `observables/Motionâ€¦` files.
 *
 * Each of the operators that returns a new observable points to this proxy
 * instead of to the canonical definition.  Thus, the cyclical reference is
 * resolved.
