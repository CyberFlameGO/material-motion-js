# Material Motion: React adaptor #

React components that make it easy to add gestures to a React application with Material Motion.

## Status: Abandoned ##

ðŸš¨ Material Motion has not been used in a production application at Google.  It is unstable and unsupported. ðŸš¨

Material Motion is an experimental project to bring gestural interaction to the Web.

The React adaptor was originally written to aid in attaching streams to/from a tree of React components.  Since then, we've discovered [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/), a framework-agnostic way to attach a stream of styles to a document's style sheet.  Because it interacts directly with the style system, it bypasses React rendering to minimize the amount of work done per-frame.  This makes JSS a more performant than [`material-motion-views-react`](http://npmjs.com/package/material-motion-views-react).

The Material Motion team recommends JSS.  This React adaptor is being published for archival purposes, but will not be maintained going forward.

## Usage ##

There are two components in this package, [`AttachStreams`](./src/components/AttachStreams.tsx) and [`TransformTarget`](./src/components/TransformTarget.tsx).

See [`TossableDemo`](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-js/blob/c50150004cd860c01953877eb02e597dca618a86/packages/demos-react/src/TossableDemo.tsx) for an example of how to use them.
